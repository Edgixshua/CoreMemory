# CoreMemory
In memory database setup for Entity Framework Core with test data generation using AutoFixture. Designed for getting your Entity Framework Core unit tests up and running as quickly as possible.

Test data generation methods are written to be as generic as possbile, allowing you to leverage AutoFixture to quickly generate the objects you need for your tests.
